[title]Legislator Committee[/title]
[subtitle]of the Coalition of the South Pacific[/subtitle]

[p]The [b]Legislator Committee[/b] or [b]LegComm[/b] is an independent body appointed by [url=cabinet_elections]the Cabinet[/url] that oversees the admission of new legislators in [url=assembly_intro]the Assembly[/url] of the South Pacific. Typically comprised of three members, the Cabinet may appoint up to five members at one time.[/p]

[h1]Members[/h1]

[p]The current members of the Legislator Committee are: {{ gov_officials.legcomm|gen_personnel_list }}[/p]

[h1]Powers and responsibilities[/h1]

[p]The Legislator Committee Act lays out the powers and responsibilities of the Legislator Committee:[/p]
[list]
[*]Verify the eligibility of legislator applicants, then accept or deny their applications accordingly
[*]Perform monthly checks to remove legislators who no longer meet the eligibility requirements
[*]Suspend the privileges of disruptive legislators on the order of the [url=coa]Chair of the Assembly[/url]
[/list]

[h1]How Legislator Committee members are chosen[/h1]

[p]The Cabinet appoints Legislator Committee members to serve in permanence but requires approval from the Assembly in a simple majority vote. Once approved by the Assembly, the Cabinet cannot dismiss a Legislator Committee member. Instead, the Assembly may revoke one's membership by recalling them in a three-fifths majority vote.[/p]

[h1]Reviewing legislator applications[/h1]

[p]Legislator applications undergo a thorough process by the Legislator Committee, ensuring that applicants in question are whom they say they are, are not applying in bad faith, or represent a security risk to the South Pacific. If necessary, the [url=crs_intro]Council on Regional Security[/url] (CRS) will inform the Legislator Committee if an applicant does pose such a risk.[/p]

[p]Typically, the Legislator Committee will review an applicant's national happenings and their Internet Protocol (IP) address to verify whether they are a person trying to circumvent a ban or commit identity fraud. In some cases, social media accounts connected to the applicant's email address will serve as additional confirmation of one's identity. If the Legislator Committee needs further confirmatory information, they will interview an applicant.[/p]

[p]Once the Legislator Committee collects all necessary information to make a decision, they will inform the applicants whether they accepted or denied their applications. Because this process involves sensitive information, the Cabinet and Assembly typically set a high bar of trustworthiness and confidence in those whom the former appoints to serve as Legislator Committee members to minimize the possibility of doxxing.[/p]
