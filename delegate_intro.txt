[title]The Delegate[/title]
[subtitle]of the Coalition of the South Pacific[/subtitle]

[subtitle]Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.delegate|info }}[/subtitle]

[p]In gameplay terms, the Delegate, or more properly the [b]World Assembly Delegate[/b], is the nation with the most World Assembly endorsements in the region and the most powerful position available, being able to perform all the region's administrative functions and to appoint Regional Officers with any combination of those powers.[/p]

[p]In terms of the region's legal structure, however, the Delegate is the Head of State of the South Pacific and is a figurehead role, with very little legal power. The [i]de facto[/i] leader of the region is the Prime Minister (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.pm|info }}).[/p]

[h1]Powers and roles[/h1]

[p]The primary purpose of the Delegate is to keep the region secure from being taken over in a coup. Its other functions are – as a strongly visible element of the regional government – being a point of contact with it, and, of course, as the region's World Assembly Delegate, to vote on World Assembly resolutions.[/p]

[h1]Delegate elections[/h1]

[p]The Delegate of the South Pacific is elected for terms lasting six months, with elections beginning on the first of January and July. Elections happen in two stages, the first being conducted on the regional forums with only [url=become_legislator]legislators[/url] voting and the second taking place via a regional poll where all regional World Assembly nations may vote.[/p]
