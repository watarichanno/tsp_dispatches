[anchor=a1_s2][/anchor][p](2) Conspiracy, defined as planning, strategizing, or otherwise showing an intent to commit an act of hostility shall itself be considered an act of hostility.[/p]


[anchor=a1_s3][/anchor][p](3) Complicity, defined as promoting, inducing, aiding or abetting an act of hostility, including a conspiracy to commit such an act, shall itself be considered an act of hostility.[/p]


[anchor=a1_s4][/anchor][p](4) Insofar as an act of hostility is committed against an ally, the victimized region must be an ally at the time of the proscription.[/p]



[b][anchor=a2][/anchor][p]2. Proscriptions[/p][/b]


[anchor=a2_s1][/anchor][p](1) A regional proscription is a prohibition on an individual or on all members of a region or organization from having a nation in any regions in the Coalition's jurisdiction.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s2][/anchor][p](2) A full proscription comprises a regional proscription as well as a prohibition on access to off-site resources of the Coalition.[/p]



[b][anchor=a3][/anchor][p]3. Grant of Authority[/p][/b]


[anchor=a3_s1][/anchor][p](1) The Cabinet or the Council on Regional Security may proscribe an individual that is not a member of the Coalition, or a foreign region or organization, that they determine to be hostile. The Cabinet together with the Council on Regional Security may proscribe a member or a group of members that they determine to be hostile.[/p]


[anchor=a3_s2][/anchor][p](2) A proscription must be issued publicly, and be accompanied with a report detailing the hostile acts. All extant proscriptions must be publicly visible at all times.[/p]


[anchor=a3_s3][/anchor][p](3) Upon proscription of a region or organization, any members of the Coalition affected by that proscription will have 7 days to demonstrably renounce their association to the satisfaction of the issuing authority before the proscription is enforced.[/p]


[anchor=a3_s4][/anchor][p](4) The issuing authority of a proscription may revoke it at any time, by issuing to the Assembly a report on why the proscription is no longer necessary to protect regional security. The Assembly may call upon the issuing authority to review an extant proscription, by passing a resolution to that effect by majority vote.[/p]



[b][anchor=a4][/anchor][p]4. Judicial Review[/p][/b]


[anchor=a4_s1][/anchor][p](1) A member of the Coalition subject to a proscription may petition the High Court for judicial review under one of the following procedures:[/p]
[anchor=a4_s1_a][/anchor][p]a. the individual may request that the High Court review underlying evidence of intelligence upon which their proscription is based; or[/p]
[anchor=a4_s1_b][/anchor][p]b. if under a proscription of a region or organization, the individual may present an appeal that they are not a member of the targeted region or organization.[/p]


[anchor=a4_s2][/anchor][p](2) In conducting a review of an individual proscription, the High Court shall only determine if the issuing authority followed the required process, has a rational basis to their interpretation of evidence and intelligence underlying the proscription, and the issuing authority hasn’t ignored exculpatory evidence.[/p]


[anchor=a4_s3][/anchor][p](3) In conducting a review in which an individual appeals that they are not a member of the targeted region or organization, the High Court shall review evidence provided by the issuing authority and the counter-claims of the individual, and determine if the individual is not a member of the targeted region or organization based upon the preponderance of the evidence.[/p]


[anchor=a4_s4][/anchor][p](4) For the purposes above, the individual must be granted adequate forum permissions to participate in the High Court proceedings for that case.[/p]



[b][anchor=a5][/anchor][p]5. Constitutional Law[/p][/b]


[anchor=a5_s1][/anchor][p](1) The Proscription Act is a constitutional law, and further amendments to it must meet constitutional amendment requirements.        	   		[/p]
