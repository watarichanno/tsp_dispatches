[title]Details on the Workings of the Delegate[/title]
[subtitle]of the Coalition of the South Pacific[/subtitle]

{{ sign.note("This dispatch uses the word 'Regional Officers', which are different from government officials. Regional Officers (RO) are nations appointed by the Delegate with some administrative powers, such as the ability to change the World Factbook Entry (WFE), flag, moderate the Message Board (RMB),... While ROs are usually the same people as government officials, the two concepts are totally different: ROs are the equivalent of forum moderators and are a feature of NationStates, while government officials are in-character positions created by our laws. Our laws don't dictate how ROs work.") }}

[h1]Powers[/h1]

[p]The Delegate is the most powerful position in-game as he/she holds the in-game Delegate seat along with all administrative powers associated with it. Powers of the Delegate can be divided into two forms:[/p]

[list]
[*][em]Technical powers:[/em] These are powers granted automatically by NationStates just by holding the in-game Delegate seat (e.g. Change WFE, flag, suppress RMB messages,...).
[*][em]Legal powers:[/em] These are powers granted by our laws, NationStates has no control over these (e.g. Establish communication policies).
[/list]

[p]The Delegate has all available technical powers granted to them, however, they have very little legal powers, so the position is just a figurehead. Most actions performed by the Delegate via technical powers are decided by other institutions of the government such as the Cabinet rather than by him/herself.[/p]

[h2]Technical powers[/h2]

[list][*][em]World Assembly:[/em] The Delegate can cast a weighted vote equal to the number of endorsements they hold on any resolution in both the General Assembly (GA) and the Security Council (SC).  In addition, the Delegate may vote to approve World Assembly proposals. Proposals that receive enough Delegate approvals and are deemed legal by the World Assembly General Secretariat will be queued up to be voted on as resolutions. This power is not regulated by any existing legislation, but, by tradition, the Delegate seeks the cabinet's advice on any SC resolutions.

[*][em]Appearance and Polls:[/em] The Delegate has the power to alter the appearance and content of the region's World Factbook Entry. This includes pinning, unpinning, and rearranging pinned dispatches according to requirement. The Delegate may also create regional polls. These powers are not regulated by any existing legislation.

[*][em]Communications:[/em] The Delegate can suppress and unsuppress posts on the Regional Message Board in accordance with [law]the Charter of the South Pacific[/law] and the moderation rules established by the Local Council. The Delegate may also send regional mass telegrams without the use of telegram stamps and set the welcome telegram, which new nations receive when they are founded in the region. Aside from that, the Delegate can enact guidelines on how other [u]in-game[/u] regional officers use their mass communication powers. These powers are regulated by [law]the Regional Communications Act[/law].

[*][em]Embassies:[/em] The Delegate is able to make embassy requests with other regions and to accept embassy requests in turn. Though not formally regulated by any existing legislation, by tradition, the Delegate usually defers this power to or seeks advice from the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

[*][em]Border Control:[/em] The Delegate has the power to eject nations from the region and ban them from returning. This power spends influence and is regulated by [law]the Border Control Act[/law].

[*][em]Executive:[/em] The Delegate is able to appoint any nation to the twelve in-game Regional Officers positions and bestow upon them any of the powers listed above. This power is regulated by [law]the Regional Officers Act[/law].
[/list]

[p]In addition to the above powers, the Delegate also holds the following legal powers and responsibilities:[/p]

[list][*][em]Regional Security:[/em] The Delegate, along with the Council on Regional Security, is responsible for ensuring that the region remains secure and that security threats are dealt with. They do this by maintaining a high endorsement count and using their Border Control powers in accordance with the Border Control Act.

[*][em]Promoting Growth and Activity:[/em] As the figurehead of the Coalition, the Delegate must work with the Cabinet and the Local Council to ensure that the region remains active and builds on what has gone before. They may use their Appearance, Communications, and Polls powers to accomplish this.

[*][em]Serving as an advisor to the Forumside Government:[/em] As a prominent figure who bridges the two main spheres of the community, the Delegate can offer advice to the Cabinet on gameside and interregional relations, as appropriate to their experience.

[*][em]Moderating the Regional Message Board:[/em] The Delegate should work with the Local Council to ensure that moderation standards are created and maintained. They can use their Appearance, Communications, and Polls powers to accomplish this.

[*][em]Fulfilling Regional Officer Positions:[/em] The Delegate must use their Executive power to ensure that elected officials are given the appropriate powers to enable them to fulfill their roles, as per the Regional Officers Act.  The Delegate must also use those powers directly in any circumstances where a Regional Officer is unable to do so.
[/list]

[h1]Delegate elections[/h1]

[p]The Delegate is elected by the Assembly and in-game nations via a two-step process. The first step involves legislators of the Assembly voting on candidates via Approval Voting, with the two candidates holding the most votes moving on to a gameside first-past-the-post vote, where whoever gets the most votes will win.[/p]

[h1]Recalls[/h1]

[p]The Delegate can be recalled by the Assembly through a Recall Resolution for dereliction of duty, abuse of authority, or violations of the law. Any legislator can initiate a Recall Resolution against the Delegate. The Resolution will be debated for three days. If the Resolution receives a motion and a second, it will be put to vote. In order for the Resolution to pass, there needs to be a 3/5 supermajority of those voting. Immediately after the Recall Resolution is passed, the Delegate will be removed from office.[/p]

[h1]Vacancies[/h1]

[p]If the current Delegate is vacant (because of resignation, recall,...) then the next nation on the succession order (jointly established by the [url=crs_intro]Council on Regional Security[/url], the Prime Minister, and the current Delegate) will become the Delegate.[/p]
