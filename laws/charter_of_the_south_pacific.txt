[anchor=aI_s4][/anchor][p](4) Any constitutional law passed by the Assembly that directly affects the gameside community or its home governance, as determined by the Chair of the Assembly, must also receive the consent of the gameside before coming into force, where that consent shall not require more than a three-fifths supermajority in a vote.[/p]


[anchor=aI_s5][/anchor][p](5) Constitutional laws passed by the Local Council hold the same status as those passed by the Assembly, limited in their scope and force to the realms of Local Council jurisdiction, but may not contradict this Charter or any law, regulation, or policy of the Assembly, Cabinet, or Council on Regional Security.[/p]

[anchor=aII_s2][/anchor][p](2) Authority and legitimacy are held jointly by the region and the forum, and the union between the two is what defines the Coalition. No illegitimate invader or usurper of the region shall be recognized.[/p]

[anchor=aIX_s5][/anchor][p](5) The Delegate and Prime Minister may jointly nominate any person meeting the requirements for membership and who are well suited to protect regional security. Prior to the nomination, the Delegate and Prime Minister will consult with the Council for their advice. To ensure collegiality and prevent dysfunction, if two-thirds of the members of the Council object to the prospective nominee’s membership, the nomination will not move forward.

[anchor=aIX_s6][/anchor][p](6) Continued membership in the Council on Regional Security is predicated upon meeting eligibility requirements.

[anchor=aIX_s7][/anchor][p](7) If a majority of the Council deems a member to be a threat to regional security, they will be suspended from the Council pending an official investigation and report to the Assembly.

[anchor=aIX_s8][/anchor][p](8) Participation, in whole or in part and at any time, in any coup d’etat or invasion of the Coalition or any of its allies will disqualify a prospective or sitting member from membership in the Council on Regional Security immediately and permanently. Participation in normal raiding, defending, or liberation efforts as part of an organized military will not be considered a violation of this clause.[/p]



[i][p]Powers[/p][/i]


[anchor=aIX_s9][/anchor][p](9) The Council on Regional Security will be responsible for establishing an appropriate cap on endorsements, ensuring that such a cap is not detrimental to the growth of the region. Enforcement of the endorsement cap should be done with leniency if a violator does not pose a significant risk to regional security.[/p]


[anchor=aIX_s10][/anchor][p](10) During a coup d’etat, whether committed by outside forces, infiltrators, or duly elected officials, the Council on Regional Security may declare a state of emergency, until such a time that a legitimate government is restored.

[anchor=aX_s2][/anchor][p](2) The military will be led by the Minister of Defense, along with a corps of generals appointed by the Minister and approved by the Assembly.

The military may not colonize or annex any region without the express permission of the Cabinet and the Assembly, by majority vote of both chambers. Nor may the military attack, subjugate, purge, destroy, or vandalize any regions, excepting those regions which espouse hateful ideologies and those regions against which the Coalition has declared an official state of war.[/p]


[anchor=aX_s4][/anchor][p](4) The Minister of Defense will coordinate with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to ensure that no military activities harm the government’s diplomatic affairs or public relations.[/p]

[anchor=aXI_s1][/anchor][p](1) Any official of the Coalition may be recalled by an Assembly resolution passed with a three-fifths majority of those voting.[/p]
[anchor=aXI_s1_a][/anchor][p]a. Recalls should only be initiated for dereliction of duty, abuse of authority, or violations of the law, and not for purposes of political rivalry.[/p]
[anchor=aXI_s1_b][/anchor][p]b. Upon initiation, recall resolutions must be debated for three days and receive a motion and second before being put to vote. [/p]
[anchor=aXI_s1_c][/anchor][p]c. Upon passage, the recalled official will immediately be removed from office.[/p]


[anchor=aXI_s2][/anchor][p](2) A Motion of No Confidence may be initiated by the Assembly if the members have lost faith in the effectiveness and activities of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Motions of No Confidence must be debated for three days and receive a motion and a second before being moved to vote. Passage requires three-fifths majority support of those voting, and triggers a special election for all Cabinet offices.[/p]



[b][anchor=aXII][/anchor][p]XII. THE ADMINISTRATION TEAM[/p][/b]



[i][p]Creating an independent, apolitical body to manage off-site communications.[/p][/i]


[anchor=aXII_s1][/anchor][p](1) The Off-Site Administration Team will be responsible for the technical maintenance of the region's Discord servers, forums, and the integrity of the database. Administrators will not be given responsibilities of a political nature.[/p]


[anchor=aXII_s2][/anchor][p](2) The Off-Site Administration Team will be responsible for the appointment and removal of its own members, except when an administrator is removed from the position following a guilty verdict in a fair trial for abuse of administrative powers. Additionally, new administrators must be approved by a majority of the Assembly before being granted administrator permissions.[/p]


[anchor=aXII_s3][/anchor][p](3) The Off-Site Administration Team must create standard administration and moderation policies. These policies will be submitted to the Assembly for a one-week review and comment period before going into effect.[/p]


[anchor=aXII_s4][/anchor][p](4) While the Off-Site Administration Team may appoint global moderators if needed, individual Ministers, the Chair of the Assembly, and roleplay moderators primarily will be responsible for the moderation of their dedicated Discord servers and forums.[/p]



[b][anchor=aXIII][/anchor][p]XIII. AMENDMENT PROCESS[/p][/b]



[i][p]Setting a procedure for amendment of the Charter and constitutional laws.[/p][/i]


[anchor=aXIII_s1][/anchor][p](1) The Assembly may amend any provision of the Charter or constitutional laws passed by the Assembly with a three-fifths supermajority. These amendments must be constitutional in nature, and amendments to the Charter must address the structure or framework of government. Bills that may exist as general laws, as determined by the Chair of the Assembly, should not be placed in the Charter or constitutional laws.[/p]


[anchor=aXIII_s2][/anchor][p](2) Any amendment to the Charter or constitutional laws that directly affects the gameside community or its home governance, as determined by the Chair of the Assembly, must also receive the consent of the gameside community before coming into force, where the consent shall not require more than a three-fifths supermajority in a vote. Additionally, the Local Council may originate amendments to its structure in the Charter, which must receive the consent of the Assembly before coming into force.[/p]


[anchor=aXIII_s3][/anchor][p](3) The Local Council will determine the qualifications and processes for amendments to its own constitutional laws.[/p]



[b][anchor=aXIV][/anchor][p]XIV. GREAT COUNCILS[/p][/b]



[i][p]Setting a procedure for constitutional conventions.[/p][/i]


[anchor=aXIV_s1][/anchor][p](1) When the Assembly wishes to debate the fundamental principles and structures of the Coalition, it may call a Great Council to rewrite all laws in their entirety, or establish a new state for the South Pacific.[/p]


[anchor=aXIV_s2][/anchor][p](2) A resolution establishing a Great Council may be adopted with a three-fifths supermajority of the Assembly, which must be confirmed by a majority vote of the gameside community.[/p]


[anchor=aXIV_s3][/anchor][p](3) The purpose of a Great Council is to rewrite all laws from the ground up, not merely to amend existing ones. The Assembly should use the normal amendment process for basic amendments, reserving Great Councils for a time when extreme changes are necessary and proper.[/p]


[anchor=aXIV_s4][/anchor][p](4) Any and all changes to regional law proposed by a Great Council may be adopted by a three-fifths supermajority of the Assembly, which must be confirmed by a majority vote of the game-side community.[/p]


[anchor=aXIV_s5][/anchor][p](5) If a Great Council fails to pass a new constitution and set of laws to replace the existing ones, then the existing laws will remain in place.[/p]


[anchor=aXIV_s6][/anchor][p](6) At least one year must have passed since the previous Great Council before a new one may be established.[/p]
