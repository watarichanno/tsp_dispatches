[title]Council on Regional Security (CRS)[/title]
[subtitle]of the Coalition of the South Pacific[/subtitle]

[p]The Council on Regional Security or CRS is a group of nations that is responsible for the internal security of [region]the South Pacific[/region]. They are one of the most crucial lines of defense against external and internal security threats. Their main purpose is monitoring, responding to regional security issues, and protecting the Delegate from a coup.[/p]

[p]For the safety and security of our region, we ask that all [url=ns_wa]World Assembly[/url] (WA) member nations in the South Pacific endorse the members of the CRS, as well as the Delegate. There is however no requirement to do so. But doing so will make you become a SWAN Knight and have some benefits others don't have so there is no reason not to do this![/p]

[h1]Members of the CRS[/h1]

[p]The CRS is composed of experienced and trustworthy members of the region. Currently, they are:[/p]
[table=noheader][tt]Number of CRS nations: {{ gov_officials.crs|count }}[/tt]
{{ gov_officials.crs|gen_table_tags_personnel }}
[/table]

[h1]Duties and powers of the CRS[/h1]

[p]Member nations of the CRS are granted Border Control power in-game, which means they can eject or ban nations. According to [law]the Charter of the South Pacific[/law], some of the duties and powers of the CRS are:[/p]

[list][*]Prevent the Delegacy from being taken by anyone other than the legally elected [url=delegate_intro]Delegate[/url].

[h1]Requirements to become a member of the CRS[/h1]

[p]In order to be eligible for membership in the CRS, one has to:[/p]

[p][em]References:[/em] [law]Section 2, Article IX of the Charter of the South Pacific[/law][/p]


[h1]How do I join the CRS?[/h1]

[list][*][em]Step 1:[/em] Make sure your nation meets the above requirements. (Become a Local Council member or become a legislator for six consecutive months. Actively endorse everyone to get the necessary endorsements and influence)
[*][em]Step 2:[/em] Submit an application to the CRS that shows you meet the requirements and the reasons on why you should be a CRS member via [url=f_crs]our forum[/url].
[/list]

[p]The CRS will review applicants and choose whether or not an application will be submitted to the Assembly for approval by legislators. The Assembly will vote on applications forwarded by the CRS, your membership will be approved by a simple majority of aye votes.[/p]

[p]Alternatively, the Delegate and [url=cabinet_intro]the Cabinet[/url] can jointly nominate you if they want you. The nomination is stopped if two-thirds of the CRS members objected. If the nomination moves pass the CRS with no objection then it will be put on a simple majority approval vote by the Assembly like above.[/p]

[p][em]References:[/em] [law]Section 3, 4, 5, Article IX of the Charter of the South Pacific[/law][/p]

[h1]Can a CRS member be removed?[/h1]

[p]Yes! A member will be removed if they don't meet the above eligibility requirements anymore. A CRS member may also be suspended and investigated if they are suspected to be a threat. After an investigation of such kind, the Assembly will need to vote on whether the member can continue to stay in the CRS.[/p]

[p]Also, like any other government official, a CRS member can be recalled by the Assembly with a resolution which requires a 3/5 supermajority to pass.[/p]

[/list]

[h1]How does the CRS perform its duties?[/h1]

[p]When detecting a nation that is causing trouble or is a potential security threat, a CRS member nations will take action by warning that nation via telegram, and ejecting or banning the nation from the region if they do not respond and curb their actions. In order to do this, something called influence needs to be used. CRS nations need a lot of influence to properly carry out their duty. In order to have a lot of influence, they need to have lots of endorsements, which is why CRS member nations' endorsement count is usually only slightly lower than that of the Delegate.[/p]

[p]The threats or troubles the CRS usually deals with are:[/p]
[list][*]Nations that continue to exceed the endorsement cap despite being told multiple times not to.
[*]A Delegate, Delegate-elect, or CRS member nation that goes rogue and threatens to coup the region.
[*]An external invasion force wants to raid and occupy the region.
[*]Spammers and trollers.
[*]Nations that violate the laws of our region and have a ban sentence from [url=court_intro]the High Court[/url].

[p](Read our [law]Criminal Code[/law] on behaviors that can cause such sentence)[/p]
