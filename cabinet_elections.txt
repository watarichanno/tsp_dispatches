[p]Instant-runoff Voting (IRV) with Optional Preferential Voting (OPV) is used for Cabinet elections. To vote, you just need to rank candidates based on your preferences on a ballot.

[p]The vote will be conducted on our regional forum in a thread designated by the Election Commission.[/p]
[list]
[*][em]Step 1:[/em] Read the [i]Declarations of Candidacy[/i] thread which is pinned in the Election Center subforum (This subforum will be uncovered when an election starts) for information on the current election, where candidates post their campaign, and where the voting thread is.
